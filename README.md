This repository contains examples and questions on while loops in Java. A while loop is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, making it useful for tasks like reading input, iterating over data, or waiting for a condition to be met.
